## About Me

I'm a Robotics Researcher passionate about developing advanced robotic perception systems. My expertise includes developing navigation systems using SLAM algorithms, and utilizing perception sensors like stereo and RGB-D cameras, and LiDAR for autonomous navigation. I have experience in geometric computations on pointclouds, and vision processings for object detection, segmentation, and real-time feedback. Additionally, I'm skilled in ROS and integrating sensory data for comprehensive robotic solutions.
